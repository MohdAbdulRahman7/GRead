# Gread

Gread aims to significantly contribute to environmental awareness and advocacy. By providing a dedicated platform for sharing green-related content, we will facilitate the dissemination of crucial information on environmental issues, sustainable practices, and eco-friendly innovations. Users can share their experiences, tips, and knowledge, fostering a community of like-minded individuals committed to environmental preservation. This collective effort will help raise awareness, inspire action, and promote sustainable living practices. Additionally, by highlighting green initiatives and success stories, our platform will motivate others to adopt environmentally friendly habits, ultimately contributing to a healthier and more sustainable planet.

This project aims to utilize all fundamental functionalities of Django, creating a robust, user-friendly, and engaging platform dedicated to promoting environmental awareness and sharing valuable green environment information.

## Functionalities

* **User Interfaces**: We will implement distinct interfaces for registered and unregistered users. Unregistered users can view public content, while registered users will have access to additional features such as creating and managing blog posts, uploading photos, and participating in discussions.
* **Authentication System**: The application will support robust user authentication, including login, logout, and password recovery features, ensuring a secure and user-friendly experience.
* **Search Functionality**: A comprehensive search bar will be integrated, allowing users to search using keywords and a top-down list for easy navigation. This feature will enable users to quickly find relevant content on the website.
* **User History Tracking**: By utilizing cookies and sessions, we will track user visits and interactions with the website. This data will be used to create a personalized User History section, similar to the one on Care2, providing insights into user engagement and activity.
* **Content Upload**: Users will have the capability to upload various types of content, including photos, documents, and other files. This feature will encourage active participation and content sharing among users.
* **Website Aesthetics**: The website will feature an eye-catching design and color scheme, ensuring an appealing and enjoyable user experience. We will use Bootstrap to style the pages, maintaining a modern and responsive design across devices.
* **Additional Pages**: We will include essential pages such as Contact Us, About Us, and Team Details to provide comprehensive information about the website and its mission.
* **Data Management**: The database will be saved in JSON format, and initial data will be loaded using fixtures. Class-based views will be utilized for updating index and detail views in `views.py`.
